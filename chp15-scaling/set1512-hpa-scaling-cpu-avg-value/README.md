> Perhaps the most important metric you’ll want to base autoscaling on is the amount of CPU consumed by the processes running inside your pods. Imagine having a few pods providing a service. When their CPU usage reaches 100% it’s obvious they can’t cope with the demand anymore and need to be scaled either up (vertical scaling—increasing the amount of CPU the pods can use) or out (horizontal scaling—increasing the number of pods).
