# 5.6.1 Creating a headless service

### Objective
1. Explore Headless Service

### Notes

- Although headless services may seem different from regular services, they aren't that different from the clients' perspective. Even with a headless service, clients can con- nect to its pods by connecting to the service's DNS name, as they can with regular services. But with headless services, because DNS returns the podsâ€™ IPs, clients connect directly to the pods, instead of through the service proxy.

- A headless services still provides load balancing across pods, but through the DNS round-robin mechanism instead of through the service proxy.
