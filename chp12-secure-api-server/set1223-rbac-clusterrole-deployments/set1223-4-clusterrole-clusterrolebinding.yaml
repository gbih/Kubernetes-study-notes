# Main task here is to assign access to a PSP via RBAC.
# This config will create a cluster-wide role named psp:restricted that can
# use the pod security policy privileged
#
# This also creates a cluster-wide role binding giving access to the 
# psp:privileged role to all authenticated users (system:authenticated)
#
# This makes the privileged policy the default for all users and
# service accounts in the cluster.
